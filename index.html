    <p><h2>About Me</h2>
Hi, my name is <strong>Kruses</strong>, but in India, I go by <i>KRUNAL</i> because it’s easier for people to pronounce. I’m currently pursuing a <u>BCA Honors</u> with a specialization in<u>Artificial Intelligence</u> and a minor in <u>Animation</u> with Ecosystem and Natural Resources.

I enjoy exploring how machines and software work behind the scenes, fixing glitches, and experimenting with new ideas.</p><p>Music is a big part of my life, I follow artists like <u><b>Lady Gaga, Shakira,</b></u>and <u><b>Modern Talking,</b></u> and I use music as emotional support during tough times.

I also love practical learning, traveling, watching the world from different perspectives, and building things from scratch. My long-term goal is to create something meaningful—whether it’s a business, a shop, or a project that combines creativity and technology.....
